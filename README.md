# 07 JetLagged: Interactive Trip Planner

## User Story

As a traveler, I would like to have an online planner with interactive tools to help me stay organzied for the next trip.

## Description

This app is an interactive trip planner that allows the user to stay organized for their next trip. This interactive web app includes simple javascript elements as well as two server-side APIs that call current data. The app also implements a css framework to provide the UI with a clean and easy-to-use design. The user is able to plan up to 5 days of activities and save them to their local storage so that the input is readily available whenever the app is refreshed. The user is also able to make instant currency conversions for some of the most-used currencies in the world. Lastly, the user is able to set pins on an interactive map to help them pinpoint places of interests during their travels. Once the trip is completed, the user is able to reset the trip and all of its data with the simple click of a button.

## Work Completed

- Implemented basic html elements alongside a comprehensive CSS framework to structure and style the webpage with an easy-to-use design.
- Used Javascript functions to save user input to local storage for data retention on page refresh
- Applied currency converter API for instant exchange rates on command
- Applied dynamic Map API to allow user to drop pins and zoom in and out of an interactive map, powered by Google
- Added a reset functionality to allow the user to clear all user input for a fresh start

## Future Development

- Add city-search functionality to interact with map api and pinpoint search location
- Develop a dynamic date range to allow the user more flexibility when planning the duration of a trip
- Improve scalability of elements on smaller screens
- Enhance map api to include direct link to GPS turn-by-turn directions
